Malmo and Mincecraft are used to create the enviroment that the AI agent will navigate. The AI agent doesn't know anything about the world and must learn how to navigate the map to reach the goal without dying. The agent can walk one block in any direction and jump two blocks in any direction. Walking and jumping have a small negative reward. Falling into the water has large negative reward, while reaching the goal has a large positive reward.


### How to Run
- Install Malmo    
- Copy finalproject.py and finalproject.xml into the Python_Example folder in Malmo.    
- Execute: python finalproject.py
